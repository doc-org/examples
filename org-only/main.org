* Introduction
This is an example of how you can use the =auto_latex= feature.
In this feature, in fact, =header.tex= is not included automatically by
doc-org.
In fact, the latex output of this file will be the same of the emacs
default export.

* Advantages
If you don't care about specific latex customization, emacs will do the work for
you.

* Disadvantages
In my opinion, if you don't like emacs defaults, it becomes complicated to
customize latex output.

* Customize latex

Here is an example of how you can customize latex output
#+begin_src
# do not show table of content
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

# custom latex class
#+LaTeX_CLASS: book

# include an entire latex file
#+LATEX_HEADER: \input{my_file.tex}

# extra packages
#+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage{my-package}
#+end_src
